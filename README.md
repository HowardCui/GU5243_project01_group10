## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a complete data processing pipeline starting from raw data acquisition to exploratory analysis and feature engineering. The primary objective is to gain practical experience in handling real-world datasets and transforming them into structured, analyzable formats that can generate meaningful insights.

The project simulates industry-level data science workflows, allowing for exposure to multiple data sources, data quality challenges, and preprocessing techniques. The final outcome includes a documented report summarizing methodologies, findings, and potential applications of the results.
